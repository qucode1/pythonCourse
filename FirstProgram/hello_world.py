# variable rules:
# variables start with a letter or underscore
# rest of the name must consist of letters, numbers or underscores
# names are case-sensitive

# naming conventions:
# snake_case
# most should be lowercase
# UPPERCASE_VARIABLES for constants (e.g. PI = 3.14)
# UpperCamelCase for classes
# variables that start and end with two underscores
#  ("dunder" or double underscore) are private and should
#  be left alone __no_touchy__
